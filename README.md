# Matches-scraper
I wrote this script in order to built a dataset of archive football matches results (half time and full time). I have presented two ways to do that. The first one uses only beautifulsoup4 for scraping and because of website's specificity it is much slower than the second method while being slightly more accurate. The second method is a combination of beautifulsoup4 and selenium and is much more efficient, but might miss some (very few) results.
